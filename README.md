# React Challenge: React Portfolio - Challenge 20

## Description
This project is the twentieth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

Starting from scratch, this challenge required writing code to do the following:
*   GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

        - WHEN I load the portfolio
        - THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer

        - WHEN I view the header
        - THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio

        - WHEN I view the navigation titles
        - THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

        - WHEN I click on a navigation title
        - THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted

        - WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
        - THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default

        - WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
        - THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them

        - WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
        - THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository

        - WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
        - THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message

        - WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
        - THEN I receive a notification that this field is required

        - WHEN I enter text into the email address field
        - THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address

        - WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
        - THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

        -WHEN I view the footer
        - THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
